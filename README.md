## About The Project

This is an Amazon Promo Codes Scrapping Tool built with puppeteer. This Tools is built for an interview challenge by Eye Popping Deals.

It makes use of the puppeteer node library to scrape an Infinite scroll Amazon Promo Codes webpage. 

**Process:**
1. opens a headless chromium browser
2. fills in login credentials and clicks signin button
3. scrolls to the bottom after a delay of 1 second and extracts promo code items
4. when the target number of items to scrape is reached, it closes the browser
5. logs scrapped items in the console.
